- Maintainance:
   - Indexing after (up to l15 is also rough.)
   - handle various DIY/Fixme/todo's
   - went through up to L11 and put key results into usefulFormulas.  Do the rest (including problem set review).
   - L17: very rough.  go through M. Luke's notes and try to make sense of things: pg 98-103.
- Spelling/grammar:
   - Audit for basic grammar, proper "latex" sentences.
   - Spell check all.
   - make sure spellcheckem is complete.
- Organization:
   - Consolidate review material into more streamlined story.
   - Better chapter/section layout (more topical, less narrative timeline)
- Problems:
   - switched ps1-3 to use makeoproblem.  Do the same for ps4 when submitted.
   - ps1-3 marked up with \withproblemsetsParagraph{} -- do the same for ps4 when submitted.
   - go back and do ps2 p4 completely (and not as I did)
   - none of the luke problems have indexing.  Did I do indexing for the 2018 problems?
- Versioning:
   -- figure out something better (apply same logic to GAelectrodynamics/ too when done)
   -- versioning for redacted version doesn't work properly (shows 0.44 instead of 0.147 -- i.e. base repo version, not current for this repo.)
      -- ie: revinfo for redacted version is probably from projects repo, not this one.  How about copy the .revinfo dir from this one.
      -- tried a makefile hack, but it didn't work.  left commented out.
