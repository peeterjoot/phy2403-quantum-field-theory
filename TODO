- 

   search for all Hw, Homework, HW and convert to problem links.

- redo as mmacell:

   hw4p2numbers.nb -- hw4p2MathematicaFig1

- what's wrong with the mmacells sty for this book?

  Some stuff would be nice to embed directly.

- go through and add various formulas to the new results appendix section.

- for each kind of detail deferred to a problem, link to that problem.
   step 1.  enumerate these problems.
   step 2.  find the context
   step 3.  link em.

- move various detailed derivations to problems, perhaps switching to theorem/lemma/... for them.

- It wasn't clear to me how we switched from equal time (t = 0) scalar \phi representation to the
   Lorentz invariant notation.  This is really a switch to the Hiesenberg picture.  Osborne makes that explicit here:

   (lecture 6)

   [implicit use of the BCH theorem in a way that may not have been obvious -- not sure he'd introduced that.]

   -- also in that lecture: he provides an experimental motivation for why we'd care about <0| [phi(x) \phi(y)] |0>
      (differences of two point correlation functions) in the first place.  I didn't understand all the steps in that discussion, but
      you at least understand that measurement results in exactly those commutators.

   Hmm.  Not sure where to mention this -- we seem to start with the time dependent fields, which wasn't how I remembered it.

- REWORK:
   - Ps2: problem 4.

      redo.

   - ps4: problem 3.

      rework the parts that I'm sure were wrong (unconditionally cancelling stuff as "unphysical".)

   - ps5

      -- try p1 and p3 again (see grading, and try incomplete parts).

- some DIY's and FIXMEs:

   qftLecture14.tex:\paragraph{Claim: (DIY):}
   qftLecture15.tex:(DIY: work through the details -- this is a problem in \citep{peskin1995introduction})
   qftLecture17.tex:(Claim: DIY)
   qftLecture23.tex:\item \( P, C, T \) : DIY

   Search for the rest of the FIXMEs (some possibly commented out).

- Maintainance:
   - Indexing is fairly rough.
      - none of the luke problems have indexing.  The 2018 problems are indexed after l15, and not much at that.
   - went through up to L11 and put key results into usefulFormulas.  Do the rest (including problem set review).

- Spelling/grammar:
   - Audit for basic grammar, proper "latex" sentences.
   - no blank line before or after equation unless new paragraph.

- Organization:
   - Consolidate review material into more streamlined story.
   - Better chapter/section layout (more topical, less narrative timeline)

- Versioning:
   -- figure out something better (apply same logic to GAelectrodynamics/ too when done)
   -- versioning for redacted version doesn't work properly (shows 0.44 instead of 0.147 -- i.e. base repo version, not current for this repo.)
      -- ie: revinfo for redacted version is probably from projects repo, not this one.  How about copy the .revinfo dir from this one.
      -- tried a makefile hack, but it didn't work.  left commented out.
