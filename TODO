- Indexing after (up to l15 is also rough.)
- Audit for basic grammar, proper "latex" sentences.
- Spell check all.
- Consolidate review material into more streamlined story.
- Better chapter/section layout (more topical, less narrative timeline)
- Merge problems into logical location.
- Redaction logic.
- handle various DIY/Fixme/todo's
- versioning fix (apply same logic to GAelectrodynamics/ too when done)
- make sure spellcheckem is complete.
- went through up to L11 and put key results into usefulFormulas.  Do the rest (including problem set review).
- L16: paper -> latex.
- L17: very rough.  go through M. Luke's notes and try to make sense of things: pg 98-103.
- switched ps1-2 to use makeoproblem.  Do the same for the rest when submitted.
- ps1-2 marked up with \withproblemsetsParagraph{} -- do the same for ps3-4 when submitted and then remove special redaction in chapters.tex
- versioning for redacted version doesn't work properly (shows 0.44 instead of 0.147 -- i.e. base repo version, not current for this repo.)
