- redo as mmacell:

   hw4p2numbers.nb -- hw4p2MathematicaFig1

- what's wrong with the mmacells sty for this book?

  Some stuff would be nice to embed directly.

- go through and add various formulas to the new results appendix section.

- for each kind of detail deferred to a problem, link to that problem.

- move various detailed derivations to problems, perhaps switching to theorem/lemma/... for them.

- It wasn't clear to me how we switched from equal time (t = 0) scalar \phi representation to the
   Lorentz invariant notation.  This is really a switch to the Hiesenberg picture.  Osborne makes that explicit here:

      https://youtu.be/1aujG95k35M?list=PLDfPUNusx1EpRs-wku83aqYSKfR5fFmfS&t=818

   (lecture 6)

   [implicit use of the BCH theorem in a way that may not have been obvious -- not sure he'd introduced that.]

   -- also in that lecture: he provides an experimental motivation for why we'd care about <0| [phi(x) \phi(y)] |0>
      (differences of two point correlation functions) in the first place.  I didn't understand all the steps in that discussion, but
      you at least understand that measurement results in exactly those commutators.

- Ps2: problem 4.

   redo.

- ps4: problem 3.

   rework the parts that I'm sure were wrong (unconditionally cancelling stuff as "unphysical".)

- ps5

- l20: on integration:

   % FIXME: \cref{dfn:qftLecture19:31}

- final spelling check:

   s/klien/klein/

   Drei -- three (long "i")
   vs.
   ich -- (I) short i

- make these problem links:

grep -ni HW[1234] *tex 

   ProblemSet3Problem3.tex:64:using the half delta function representation from Hw2, this reduces to
   qftLecture15b.tex:57:Contractions allow time ordered products to be written in a compact form.  In HW4 we are set with the task of demonstrating how this is done (i.e. proving \underline{Wick's theorem}.)
   qftLecture16.tex:101:HW4 has a coupling like \( (h/V) \partial_\mu \phi^a \partial^\mu \phi^a \) for which a \( h \rightarrow \phi^a \phi^a \) decay is possible.
   qftLecture19.tex:829:We will see (HW4) that Lorentz transformations take the form
   qftLecture19.tex:1075:and (from HW4)
   qftLecture9.tex:237:\paragraph{Example from HW2:}

(when fixing, search for any remaining).

- SL, SU, SO looks weird in the book (example Lecture19: I think they looked okay in the standalone article based lecture notes).  Use a macro for those instead to handle nicer formatting.

- some DIY's:

   qftLecture14.tex:\paragraph{Claim: (DIY):}
   qftLecture15.tex:(DIY: work through the details -- this is a problem in \citep{peskin1995introduction})
   qftLecture17.tex:(Claim: DIY)
   qftLecture23.tex:\item \( P, C, T \) : DIY

- Maintainance:
   - Indexing after (up to l15 is also rough.)
   - handle various DIY/Fixme/todo's
   - went through up to L11 and put key results into usefulFormulas.  Do the rest (including problem set review).
- Spelling/grammar:
   - Audit for basic grammar, proper "latex" sentences.
   - Spell check all.
   - make sure spellcheckem is complete.
- Organization:
   - Consolidate review material into more streamlined story.
   - Better chapter/section layout (more topical, less narrative timeline)
- Problems:
   - go back and do ps2 p4 completely (and not as I did)
   - none of the luke problems have indexing.  Did I do indexing for the 2018 problems?
- Versioning:
   -- figure out something better (apply same logic to GAelectrodynamics/ too when done)
   -- versioning for redacted version doesn't work properly (shows 0.44 instead of 0.147 -- i.e. base repo version, not current for this repo.)
      -- ie: revinfo for redacted version is probably from projects repo, not this one.  How about copy the .revinfo dir from this one.
      -- tried a makefile hack, but it didn't work.  left commented out.
