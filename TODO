- standarize on \pi, not \Pi.

- use one of \Abs{\Bp} or \Norm{\Bp} for vector magnitude, but not both (as I believe I'm doing).

- incorporate: momentumDirac.tex, DiracUVmatricesExplicit.tex

   (as appendix or digression)

   -- work the problem of finding 3.105 from 3.99/3.100.

- l22: 

   Go through emily's notes and merge with Stefan's.

- l23:
  
   Finish

- Ps2: problem 4.

   redo.

- ps4: problem 3.

   rework the parts that I'm sure were wrong (unconditionally cancelling stuff as "unphysical".)

- ps5

- l20: on integration:

   % FIXME: \cref{dfn:qftLecture19:31}

- final spelling check:

   s/klien/klein/

   Drei -- three (long "i")
   vs.
   ich -- (I) short i

- translate 

   s/KG/Klein-Gordon/g

- FIXME: link: diracWeylMatrixRepresentationAndIdentities.nb
   Link to this and various other notebooks at the appropriate points and generate a mathematica.tex for this book.
   -- need to go through those .nb's and add metadata info for each.

- make these problem links:

grep -ni HW[1234] *tex 

   ProblemSet3Problem3.tex:64:using the half delta function representation from Hw2, this reduces to
   qftLecture15b.tex:57:Contractions allow time ordered products to be written in a compact form.  In HW4 we are set with the task of demonstrating how this is done (i.e. proving \underline{Wick's theorem}.)
   qftLecture16.tex:101:HW4 has a coupling like \( (h/V) \partial_\mu \phi^a \partial^\mu \phi^a \) for which a \( h \rightarrow \phi^a \phi^a \) decay is possible.
   qftLecture19.tex:829:We will see (HW4) that Lorentz transformations take the form
   qftLecture19.tex:1075:and (from HW4)
   qftLecture9.tex:237:\paragraph{Example from HW2:}

(when fixing, search for any remaining).

- SL, SU, SO looks weird in the book (example Lecture19: I think they looked okay in the standalone article based lecture notes).  Use a macro for those instead to handle nicer formatting.

- Maintainance:
   - Indexing after (up to l15 is also rough.)
   - handle various DIY/Fixme/todo's
   - went through up to L11 and put key results into usefulFormulas.  Do the rest (including problem set review).
   - L17: very rough.  go through M. Luke's notes and try to make sense of things: pg 98-103.
- Spelling/grammar:
   - Audit for basic grammar, proper "latex" sentences.
   - Spell check all.
   - make sure spellcheckem is complete.
- Organization:
   - Consolidate review material into more streamlined story.
   - Better chapter/section layout (more topical, less narrative timeline)
- Problems:
   - switched ps1-3 to use makeoproblem.  Do the same for ps4 when submitted.
   - ps1-3 marked up with \withproblemsetsParagraph{} -- do the same for ps4 when submitted.
   - go back and do ps2 p4 completely (and not as I did)
   - none of the luke problems have indexing.  Did I do indexing for the 2018 problems?
- Versioning:
   -- figure out something better (apply same logic to GAelectrodynamics/ too when done)
   -- versioning for redacted version doesn't work properly (shows 0.44 instead of 0.147 -- i.e. base repo version, not current for this repo.)
      -- ie: revinfo for redacted version is probably from projects repo, not this one.  How about copy the .revinfo dir from this one.
      -- tried a makefile hack, but it didn't work.  left commented out.
- reflection: FIXME: (when l19 included).
