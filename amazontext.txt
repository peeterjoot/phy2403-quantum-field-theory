This is a set of course notes from the Fall 2018, University of Toronto Quantum Field Theorry (PHY2403), taught by Prof. Erich Poppitz.  
<p>
This course covered:
<ul>
<li> Introduction: Energy and distance scales; units and conventions.  Uncertainty relations in the relativistic domain and the need for multiple particle description.  
<li> Canonical quantization.  Free scalar field theory.  
<li> Symmetries and conservation laws.  
<li> Interacting fields: Feynman diagrams and the S matrix; decay widths and phase space.  
<li> Spin 1/2 fields: Spinor representations, Dirac and Weyl spinors, Dirac equation.  Quantizing fermi fields and statistics.  
<li> Vector fields and Quantum electrodynamics.  
</ul>
<p>
This book contains:
<ul>
<li> Lecture notes.  
<li> Personal notes exploring auxiliary details.  
<li> Worked practice problems.  - My solutions (as-is, with errors.  ) for problem sets 1-4.  
</ul>
