- review the problems from Luke's QFT I -- anything worth keeping?
   -- most.  One problem is somewhat redundant.

- make these problem links:

qftLecture9.tex:237:\paragraph{Example from HW2:}
qftLecture15b.tex:57:Contractions allow time ordered products to be written in a compact form.  In HW4 we are set with the task of demonstrating how this is done (i.e. proving \underline{Wick's theorem}.)
qftLecture16.tex:100:HW4 has a coupling like \( (h/V) \partial_\mu \phi^a \partial^\mu \phi^a \) for which a \( h \rightarrow \phi^a \phi^a \) decay is possible.
qftLecture19.tex:836:We will see (HW4) that Lorentz transformations take the form
qftLecture19.tex:1080:and (from HW4)

- final spelling check:

   s/klien/klein/

   Drei -- three (long "i")
   vs.
   ich -- (I) short i

- mathimagefigure for the mathematica notebooks.

- convert underbraces to mathLabelBox's

- FIXME: link: diracWeylMatrixRepresentationAndIdentities.nb
   Link to this and various other notebooks at the appropriate points.

- need to go through those .nb's and add metadata info for each.

- periods ending sections, chapters, figure labels, ...

- standarize on \pi, not \Pi.

- use one of \Abs{\Bp} or \Norm{\Bp} for vector magnitude, but not both (as I believe I'm doing).

- work the problem of finding 3.105 from 3.99/3.100. (Dirac momentum operator)

- l22: 

   Go through emily's notes and merge with Stefan's (ongoing).

   Post those when done, and send FB messenger links to each of them.

   Credit them in the preface.
