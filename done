- FIXME: link: diracWeylMatrixRepresentationAndIdentities.nb
   Link to this and various other notebooks at the appropriate points.

- need to go through those .nb's and add metadata info for each.

- periods ending sections, chapters, figure labels, ...

- standarize on \pi, not \Pi.

- use one of \Abs{\Bp} or \Norm{\Bp} for vector magnitude, but not both (as I believe I'm doing).

- work the problem of finding 3.105 from 3.99/3.100. (Dirac momentum operator)

- l22: 

   Go through emily's notes and merge with Stefan's (ongoing).

   Post those when done, and send FB messenger links to each of them.

   Credit them in the preface.

- translate
