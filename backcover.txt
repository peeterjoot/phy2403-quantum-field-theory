This is a set of course notes from the Fall 2018, University of Toronto Quantum Field Theorry (PHY2403), taught by Prof. Erich Poppitz.

This course covered:

- Introduction: Energy and distance scales; units and conventions. Uncertainty relations in the relativistic domain and the need for multiple particle description.
- Canonical quantization. Free scalar field theory.
- Symmetries and conservation laws.
- Interacting fields: Feynman diagrams and the S matrix; decay widths and phase space.
- Spin 1/2 fields: Spinor representations, Dirac and Weyl spinors, Dirac equation. Quantizing fermi fields and statistics.
- Vector fields and Quantum electrodynamics. 

This book contains:

- Lecture notes.
- Personal notes exploring auxiliary details.
- Worked practice problems.
- My solutions (as-is, with errors.) for problem sets 1-4.
