\makeproblem{Lorentz transforms of spinors---some useful identities}{qft:problemSet4:4}{

{\flushleft{C}}onsider the matrix $$\Lambda_{1\over 2} = e^{- {i\over 2} \omega_{\mu\nu} S^{\mu\nu}}~.$$
Here, $S^{\mu\nu} = {i\over 4} [\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu ]$ is as defined in class, in terms of the four $\gamma$-matrices (notice that, when using the representation of the $\gamma$ matrices in terms of Pauli matrices, the matrix $\Lambda_{1\over 2}$ looks like two sets of $M$ (and $M^*$) matrices discussed in class, now combined into one four-by-four object).

\makesubproblem{}{qft:problemSet4:4a}
Show that $\Lambda_{1\over 2}^{-1} \gamma^\mu \Lambda_{1\over 2} = \Lambda^\mu_{\; \nu} \gamma^\nu$, where $ \Lambda^\mu_{\; \nu}$ is the usual Lorentz transformation acting on vectors. (Feel free to show this for the infinitesimal form of the transformations, but then argue that the finite form holds as well.)
\makesubproblem{}{qft:problemSet4:4b}
Show that $\Lambda_{1\over 2}^{\dagger} \gamma^0 \Lambda_{1\over 2} =  \gamma^0$.
\makesubproblem{}{qft:problemSet4:4c}
Consider the fermion bilinear $\bar\psi \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu \psi ={1\over 2} \bar\psi \{ \gamma^\mu ,\gamma^\nu \} \psi + {1\over 2} \bar\psi [\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu] \psi$, where $\{A,B\} = AB + BA$ is the anticommutator. Show that the two terms on the right transform as a scalar and a second-rank tensor, respectively, under Lorentz transformations.
